## ⚙️ Frontend Technologies

The frontend of the Shopping List application is built using a modern stack that ensures high performance, responsiveness, and a great user experience:

- **React** – A popular JavaScript library for building interactive and reusable UI components. React enables the creation of a dynamic interface where the state updates seamlessly as users interact with the app.

- **Vite** – A fast, modern build tool and development server for frontend projects. Vite provides lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds, making development smooth and efficient.

- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom and responsive designs. Tailwind allows precise styling directly in the markup without writing custom CSS from scratch.

- **daisyUI** – A lightweight component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. It provides pre-designed UI components such as buttons, modals, forms, and cards, helping to speed up development while maintaining a modern design aesthetic.
